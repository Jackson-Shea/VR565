# VR Personal Fitness Trainer

A virtual reality fitness application designed to guide users through motion-tracked workouts with real-time feedback. The project focuses on usability, engagement, and accurate movement validation in immersive environments.

## Overview
The VR Personal Fitness Trainer was built to explore how immersive technology can improve workout guidance, form correction, and user motivation. The experience places users in a guided VR environment where exercises are tracked and evaluated in real time.

The project emphasizes:
- User-centered design
- Clear feedback loops
- Iterative feature development
- Balancing UX goals with technical constraints

## Key Features
- Motion-tracked workout guidance using VR controllers
- Real-time visual feedback to reinforce proper form
- Session progress tracking and performance feedback
- Intuitive UI designed for in-headset readability and ease of use

## Product & UX Approach
- Conducted early ideation to define core user goals and success metrics
- Translated user needs into feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- Designed interaction flows to minimize cognitive load in VR
- Iterated on UI placement, feedback timing, and gestures based on testing

## Technology Stack
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Language:** C#
- **XR:** Oculus SDK / Unity XR
- **Backend:** Firebase (authentication and progress tracking)
- **Platform:** Meta Quest (APK build)

## Development Highlights
